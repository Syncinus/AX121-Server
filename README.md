# AX121-Server
The AX121 server project

## Guide to run:
Download the repository, and then `npm run start` to load up the
game onto your local machines port 8080, after that go to the client
site, `ax121-client.glitch.me`, and the game will automatically connect.

The experimental commands system is based off of readline, so to use it
simply type the command into the output terminal and the game will automatically
parse it into a command and give you errors based on that. Currently no actual
commands exist.

Most of the game is considered stable at the moment, however in newer systems such as
the AXL chunkloader and the command system, problems may be present, though
they are both tested and shouldn't be gamebreaking.
